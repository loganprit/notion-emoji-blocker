# Notion Emoji Blocker

A Chrome extension that blocks Notion from replacing system emoji with the Twitter emoji spritesheet, allowing you to see your system's native emoji instead.

## What it does

This extension prevents Notion from loading the Twitter emoji spritesheet (`twitter-emoji-spritesheet-64.2d0a6b9b.png`) by:
- Using Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API to block the network request
- Intercepting fetch() and XMLHttpRequest calls as a backup method
- Logging blocked requests to the console for debugging

## Installation

1. **Download the extension files**
   - Save all files in this folder to your computer

2. **Enable Developer Mode in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Toggle "Developer mode" on (top right corner)

3. **Load the extension**
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing these extension files
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

4. **Verify installation**
   - Navigate to Notion.so
   - Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab
   - You should see "Notion Emoji Blocker: Content script loaded"
   - Any blocked emoji requests will be logged

## How to test

1. Go to any Notion page with emoji
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab
3. Look for messages like "Blocked Twitter emoji spritesheet request"
4. Emoji should now display using your system's native emoji instead of Twitter's
